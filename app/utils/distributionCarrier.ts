// Pure carrier selection for a payment operation (#109, PROCESSING.md §2 Этап D / §9). A portal
// whose tariff SUPPORTS smart processes carries each payment as an SP ELEMENT (the partial-
// distribution ledger, §9); one that doesn't carries it as a configurable ACTIVITY (дело).
//
// Tariff up/downgrade affects ONLY new operations — existing carriers are NEVER migrated
// (PROCESSING.md §2: «уже созданные дела остаются; при даунгрейде накопленные элементы СП не
// удаляем»). That invariant needs no state here: the choice is made per NEW operation from the
// CURRENT facts, and existing operations keep whatever carrier they were written with (their B24
// dedup marker already identifies them). No I/O — the crm.type.list probe that produces the facts,
// and the provisioning that follows `shouldProvisionSp`, are transport slices.
