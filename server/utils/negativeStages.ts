// Build ONE `isNegativeStage` predicate covering a whole portal's invoice AND deal
// stages (#109, PROCESSING.md §2), so the crm-sync allocation lookups drop candidates
// sitting in a lost/failed stage — AND a SETTLED (paid) invoice, which must not re-match
// a second same-amount payment (the negative filter alone let a paid invoice back in;
// mirrors paymentLookup's `paid:'Y'` drop). Pure over an injected `RestCall` (+ the
// `stageLoader` primitives) — unit-testable without the network.
//
// WHY A UNION. A candidate's category isn't known until it is queried, and the
// `isNegativeStage` predicate is applied INLINE inside each resolver (invoiceLookup /
// itemByIdLookup / paymentLookup) — it can't do REST per candidate. So we pre-load the
// negative stages of EVERY category of both entity types and union them into one set.
// This is safe because the stage-id namespaces do NOT collide:
//   • invoices → `DT31_<cat>:<code>` (e.g. «Не оплачен» `DT31_11:D`)
//   • deals    → `LOSE`/`APOLOGY` (default funnel) or `C<cat>:LOSE` (categorized)
// A `crm.item.list` candidate's `stageId` equals its `crm.status.list` `STATUS_ID`
// (confirmed live), so one combined set matches every candidate's `stageId` directly —
// invoices, deals, and the deal-payment company pool (which filters deals by stage).
//
// COST is a handful of REST calls per portal (`crm.category.list` ×2 + `crm.status.list`
// per category), so the caller loads this ONCE PER JOB (lazily) and reuses the predicate
// for every operation — not once per op. See docs/QUEUES.md «REST-бюджет проводки».
