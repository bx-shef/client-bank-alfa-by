#
# Crypto gateway for Priorbank production (#460).
#
# WHAT IT IS. Priorbank's production Open Banking host speaks TLS with Belarusian
# ciphersuites (STB 34.101.65 / BTLS). Node — and every stock TLS stack — aborts at
# ServerHello with "unknown cipher returned". This image is an nginx that terminates
# ordinary plain HTTP on the inside and re-originates the request to the bank over a
# BTLS session, using the OPEN implementation (bee2 + bee2evp, Apache 2.0), so we do
# not depend on the proprietary vendor (#41, #457).
#
# WHY nginx AND NOT A TCP TUNNEL (stunnel/socat). Two reasons, both measured:
#   - a TCP tunnel cannot rewrite the Host header, so the bank would receive
#     `Host: crypto-gw:1080` and reject the request;
#   - the BIGN handshake is expensive, and `keepalive` amortises it across a whole
#     poll (~10 HTTP requests collapse onto one upstream TLS session).
# nginx also closes chain AND hostname verification with one directive
# (`proxy_ssl_verify on`), which stunnel does not — its `verifyChain` alone accepts
# ANY certificate issued by the same CA.
#
# The compiler never reaches the runtime image: OpenSSL, the engine and nginx are all
# built in throwaway stages (that is the point of the issue title).
#
# Build/run: see README.md next to this file.

# Pins. Everything that can drift is nailed down here — a "latest" base or a mutable
